1,514A (Gotham),Bruce Wayne,,10,"He was one of the many prisoners of Indian Hill to be transferred to another facility upstate on the orders of The Court. However, Fish Mooney hijacks the bus and drives it into Gotham City, where the bus crashes when fired upon by Butch Gilzean and his gang. After the mobsters flee at the sight of a resurrected Fish, she herself leaves the scene. An elderly hobo lady hears the cries of the prisoners and releases them, only to be horrified by their monstrous appearance. The monsters depart the prison van and make their way into Gotham City. The Bruce Wayne look-alike departs the bus and thanks the elderly woman before entering the city himself The look-a-like later saw Selina Kyle and Ivy Pepper give some money to a street gang. After Selina Kyle leaves to go meet up with Fish Mooney and her gang, Ivy is visited by the Bruce Wayne look-a-like. He frantically asks her who Bruce Wayne is, confused as to why he looks almost identical to him. Confused and terrified, Ivy runs off to inform Selina of his odd behavior. The look-a-like later snuck into Wayne Manor where Bruce and Alfred Pennyworth find him and are surprised by his appearance. He begs them not to hurt him.While helping himself to some food, the look-a-like stated to Bruce that he was known as Subject 514A and states that he never knew about the other Indian Hill subjects until he was loaded onto the bus that he was later freed from. Bruce objected to Alfred's suggestion to turn him over to someone. Subject 514A later visits Bruce's sparing match with Alfred. Taking his shot with Alfred, Subject 514A managed to easily counter Alfred's moves. When Subject 514A managed to get punched in the nose, Alfred saw that he didn't feel pain. Alfred and Bruce then noticed the scar on the back of his neck. Bruce looks for a clue for the scar on Subject 514A and hides him when Selina Kyle came into view. After watching Bruce and Selina's conversation, Subject 514A started to begin mimicking Bruce's voice. Later that night while Bruce is sleeping, Subject 514A starts cutting his hair. The next morning, Bruce and Alfred find out what Subject 514A did upon finding his cut hair and Bruce's missing clothes. Bruce tells Alfred that they need to find him. Subject 514A arrives in one of the cars from Wayne Manor and invites Selina Kyle to have food with him. While Selina is suspicious on why ""Bruce"" is acting strange, she goes with him anyway.The next day, Selina and Subject 514A walked down the streets as they approach a bar. As Selina goes into the bar, Subject 514A is told to go around back. As Selina is about to have her fingers cut off by the two owners, Subject 514A comes in and beats up the two men. Selina is then cut loose by Subject 514A. After getting away, Selina discovers that Subject 514A is wounded. Upon noticing the scars on him, Selina sees that he is not Bruce. Selina stitches up Subject 514A who states that he has no knowledge of why he was made to look like him and claims that Bruce might have an interest in Selina after watching them from the halls. After being told by Selina about what happened to Firefly and Ivy, Subject 514A then kisses Selina. Bruce and Alfred catch up to Subject 514A who claims that Bruce doesn't know what he wants. Subject 514A claims that he doesn't know why he was created and states that he doesn't belong in Gotham City. He then jumps off the building telling them to say goodbye to Selina for him. Bruce and Alfred then see Subject 514A walk off into the streets. Subject 514A is later visited by Kathryn and Talon while walking on the streets. Kathryn states to Subject 514A that they are his ""real parents"" who have been looking for him for a long time. Subject 514A is then loaded into Kathryn's limo by Talon.",,100,20,30,50,35,100,"['Durability', 'Reflexes', 'Super Strength']","['Batgod', 'Batman', 'Batman (1966)', 'Batman (Arkham)', 'Batman (Burtonverse)', 'Batman (Dark Knight Returns)', 'Batman (DCAU)', 'Batman (DCEU)', 'Batman (Final Batsuit)', 'Batman (Gotham By Gaslight)', 'Batman (Gotham Knight)', 'Batman (Gotham)', 'Batman (Injustice)', 'Batman (Kingdom Come)', 'Batman (New 52)', 'Batman (Pre-Crisis)', 'Batman (Smallville)', 'Batman (The Brave And The Bold)', 'Battle-Suit Batman (DCEU)', 'Black Lantern', 'Dark Knight', 'Dawnbreaker', 'Devastator', 'Green Lantern Batman', 'Grim Knight', 'Hellbat', 'Insider', 'Justice Buster', 'Merciless', 'Murder Machine', 'Red Death', 'Superbat', 'The Batman Who Laughs', 'White Lantern', 'Yellow Lantern']","['Subject 514A', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Bruce 2']",,,DC Comics,,,,[],Bruce Wayne (genetic template),,,-,-,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

68,Anti-Venom,Eddie Brock,Edward Charles Allan Brock,10,"Check Venom I for previous history.   Thanks to Mr.Li's ""mysterious powers."" Eddie was cured of both his cancer and the remnants of the symbiote. Unfortunately, the current Venom entered the F.E.A.S.T. center looking for Spider-man. He found Eddie and the symbiote began to crawl onto him again. However, Mr. Li's powers clash with the takeover and they formed Anti-Venom. Later in a fight against Spider-man, he noticed his foe rescue an innocent old man. Inspired, Anti-venom helped Spidey cure the current Venom. He engaged Venom in a fight, and after receiving some help from Spider-Man, cured Gargan from the symbiote, but also felt some remnants of the symbiote inside Peter's blood and began ""curing"" him as well, but also ended up sucking the radiation from Spider-Man's blood, something that might depower him.    Later, Thunderbolts guards arrived to took the disabled Gargan to the ship while Songbird and Radioactive Man battled Spider-Man and Anti-Venom. After the fight, Anti-Venom snuck on the Thunderbolts ship and stole back Peter Parker's camera, looted by Norman Osborn in a bid to reverse engineer the tracing system allowing the camera to zero on Spider-Man's chest. He was able to help Peter escape Osborn's tracer and forewarns him about the villain's next move in a show of friendship and good-will.     Anti-Venom led Spider-Man to Oscorp and the two split up. Brock disguised himself as Spider-Man to distract the other Thunderbolts while Spider-Man went after Osborn. After webbing up Songbird and Radioactive Man to a wall, Anti-Venom faced Gargan, who was now wearing a new Scorpion battlesuit to protect his recovering symbiote. After a grueling battle Gargan, as Scorpion, hit Anti-Venom with his stinger and injected a poisonous formula that seemingly destroyed Brock's symbiote. Gargan (now Venom III) advanced to kill Brock but was met with resistance by his Venom symbiote. The symbiote gained strength and broke though Gargan's battle suit, refusing to let Gargan kill Brock. Gargan explained that the alien still loved Brock too much and gave up, but he promised Brock that he would get past this problem and someday finish him off, to which Brock replied ""not if I kill you first."" Unknown to Gargan, Brock's Anti-Venom suit reformed. Now a fugitive for helping Spider-Man and fighting the Thunderbolts, Brock was back on the streets, planning to continue his former vigilante antihero career with seemingly increased religious emphasis as The Anti-Venom. He even cured a young girl, Jenna Cole, from her heroin addiction. Brock was the first person to find out that Martin Li was Mister Negative. In the end, Eddie questioned his own faith and cried out that no one would believe him, because he was a monster.     Working with Jenna Cole, Eddie fought crime in the sleazier areas of New York, having separated themselves from the F.E.A.S.T. foundation. As Anti-Venom he would ""cure"" the streets of drug traders after Jenna would go undercover to lure them out. He became increasingly unstable mentally, reverting back to his ""Venom"" personality and was overtly/near lethally protective of Jenna. At a drug bust Eddie walked in on the Quintas gang after they had captured Jenna, preparing to transform until the Punisher intervened. Anti-Venom and Castle slaughtered the criminals until a gang member took Jenna hostage. Eddie stopped Castle from shooting the gang member through Jenna, however upon hearing his full name (Eddie Brock the serial killer) he shot Anti-Venom in the head with a shotgun. Anti-Venom recovered and attacked the Punisher in retaliation. Eddie and the Punisher almost killed each other, but Eddie declared a truce, saying that if the Punisher didn't back down he'd make him go to Mexico with him in a wheelchair and that he could drive the Punisher's van. The Punisher agreed to the truce, but tried to kill Eddie again during the border crossing with a knife. He dropped Eddie off at the compound, figuring Eddie would die instead of him, and this way he planned to take care of two birds with one stone. When he talked on the phone to the leader of the Quintas gang and found that Jenna had relapsed and was doing drugs again, Eddie lost control and tore one of the Quintas in half in a fit of rage. After killing the remaining guards, Eddie rejoined the Punisher, and the two launched an attack on the Quintas. At the end of the raid, Eddie found a severely drugged Jenna, who seemed afraid of his Anti-Venom costume. After withdrawing the symbiote into himself, Eddie managed to calm her down. At this point, the Punisher attempted to snipe Eddie from a distance, but ultimately decides not to, later he had found out he had ran out of ammo. After the Punisher left, Jenna and Eddie took a jeep and returned home. ","  The alien costume's remnants remained grafted to the nervous system of Eddie Brock, and fused with his white blood cells. This new white symbiote seems to not only be different in appearance abilities, but even acts completely different from the original symbiote it evolved from. For instance, Eddie Brock refers to himself in first person as Anti-Venom, and is in complete control of his actions. This relationship is somewhat similar to Cletus Kasady's and the Carnage symbiote: Both symbiotes are bonded to their hosts at the cellular level and seem to compliment the user's personality (the Carnage symbiote loves to kill, and the Anti-Venom symbiote wants to destroy Venom.) However the white symbiote, unlike the other members of its race, seemingly has no influence on Eddie's actions, which is a far cry from his first symbiotic relationship.    Upon being assaulted by Mac Gargan, the Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to bond with Brock again. However Brock's skin is caustic to his former symbiote, which means the white symbiote has the ability to reject the Venom symbiote and presumably all of its children as well.    Anti-Venom can manipulate his matter to enlarge or stretch his body in order to augment his attacks. For example, he enlarged his fist and slammed it into Mac Gargan creating more of an impact.    Anti-Venom can sense foreign substances within a person's body which includes symbiotes, radiation, narcotics, viruses and diseases.    After sensing the impurity, Anti-Venom can forcefully ""cure"" the substance from the person's body. He uses this ability to almost completely destroy his old symbiote and to cure a young girl from her heroin addiction. This power can also be used to depower some superhumans, almost ridding Spider-Man of the radiation in his blood when attempting to destroy remnants of the symbiote, and nearly cleanses Radioactive Man of his powers in a similar fashion.    After failing to cleanse Spider-Man of his symbiote remnants and radiation in his blood, whenever Anti-Venom is too close to Peter his powers are effectively canceled until Eddie becomes distant enough from him. Excluding these new powers granted by the white symbiote, Anti-Venom still retains almost every power Eddie had bonded with the Venom symbiote.",90,60,65,90,95,85,"['Accelerated Healing', 'Camouflage', 'Danger Sense', 'Durability', 'Elasticity', 'Enhanced Senses', 'Reflexes', 'Shapeshifting', 'Stamina', 'Super Strength', 'Symbiote Costume', 'Toxin and Disease Resistance', 'Wallcrawling', 'Web Creation']","['Child Of Venom', 'Magic Venom', 'Toxin', 'Venom', 'Venom (SONY)']","['Eddie, Edwin Brock, Venom, Lethal Protector, White Venom, 998th']","San Francisco, California",Amazing Spider-Man #569 (as Anti-Venom),Marvel Comics,,Vigilante; former journalist for the Daily Globe,"New York, New York",['Anachronauts'],"Carl Brock (father, estranged), Janine Brock (mother, deceased), Mary Brock (sister), Ann Weying (ex-wife, deceased), Symbiotes' relatives: Toxin Symbiote (current symbiote, former grandson), Venom Symbiote (former symbiote, grandfather, former brother), Agony, Phage, Riot, Lasher (uncles, former sons), Scorn (sister, former niece), Carnage (father, former son), Scream (aunt, former daughter, deceased), Hybrid (uncle, former son, deceased)",Male,Symbiote,7'6 • 229 cm,795 lb • 358 kg,Blue,Blond,,/pictures2/portraits/10/050/1485.jpg?v=1445764013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
69,Apocalypse (FOX),En Sabah Nur,,34,"Apocalypse, known to others by his birth name ""En Sabah Nur"", was born in 8000 B.C. (claiming to have been worshiped by several ancient civilizations over his many lives, being called Elohim, Shen, and Ra, among other names), and is the firstborn of the mutant race, as he rules the world in Akkaba of prehistoric Egypt. According to Moira, wherever Apocalypse was, he always had four primary followers that he would bestow powers to, and wherever he ruled, it would eventually end in a cataclysm or an apocalypse of some sort. Throughout his reign, he had helped grow and eventually destroy many cities and civilizations before recorded history. Due to this, he started to believe himself to be a god; he thought that he was untouchable, and able to kill at a whim. A young Apocalypse is first seen. In prehistoric Egypt, a young En Sabah Nur is seen in using his powers to construct a pyramid while a vast crowd of people bow before him, chanting his name while his Horsemen look on. Apocalypse begins transferring his consciousness. While performing a transferal of his essence into a new mutant's body, one with instantaneous healing, his worshipers betray him and set forth the destruction of his pyramid. The Four Horsemen ensure Apocalypse still survives the ordeal even as the monument is collapsed, killing the followers while keeping En Sabah Nur entombed for millennia. In the original timeline, Apocalypse remains dormant in his tomb. It is unknown if a modern cult developed around him, or is it certain if the Sentinels detected him or not. Following the 1973 incidents that revealed mutantkind to the wider world, a group of Egyptians started the Cult of En Sabah Nur (or Ashir En Sabah Nur, according to Moira MacTaggert) and discovered where his resting place lied in Cairo. As Moira investigated them in 1983, she saw En Sabah Nur awaken at the ruins, killing the cultists. En Sabah Nur decides to explore the modern day world, and while roaming Cairo, he sees street thief Ororo Munroe use her weather control powers to steal food. The shopkeepers go to threaten Ororo, before being interrupted by the intervention of Apocalypse. After miscommunication due to En Sabah Nur speaking outdated dialects, he eventually kills the men chasing Ororo by using sand to punch through the sides of their necks and literally melting the last into a wall. Ororo takes En Sabah Nur to her house. Once he sees a television, touching it enables Apocalypse's powers to connect to all broadcasts in the world, making him learn modern languages and how mankind evolved the previous millennia. Believing that without his presence, humanity has grown weaker, he decides to destroy it in order to rebuild society from his point of view. He enhances Ororo's powers to turn her into the first of the new Horsemen. Apocalypse and Storm then go to Berlin seeking Caliban, a mutant broker who knows the location of other Homo superior. Caliban refuses to concede information without getting paid and draws a gun on En Sabah Nur, who proceeds to use his powers to disintegrate it. Caliban's enforcer Psylocke then extends a sword and her psi-katana upon Apocalypse to protect her boss. Impressed, En Sabah Nur goes on to enhance Psylocke and turn her into a Horseman, and she replies by taking her to a powerful mutant. Angel, a former cage fighter who went into drunk depression after injuring his wings fighting Nightcrawler, becomes the third Horseman as Apocalypse replaces his wings with metal ones, renaming him ""Archangel"", ""my Angel of Death"". X-MEN APOCALYPSE 51.png Apocalypse vows to destroy and rebuild the entire world. After recruiting the trio, Apocalypse arrives together with them to a steel plant factory in Poland, where Erik Lehnsherr, also known as ""Magneto"", wants to kill his former co-workers for causing the death of his wife and daughter. Apocalypse kills the workers by fusing them to the ground, and teleports with Magneto to Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Erik had seen his powers awaken 40 years prior. After some encouragement from En Sabah Nur, who tells Erik that Earth's magnetic field and ground metals can be exploited by Magneto's powers, Erik proceeds to destroy the ruins, finally giving him some closure, and promptly agrees to join forces with the ancient mutant (who further enhances Erik's already immense mutant powers), becoming his fourth and final Horseman of the Apocalypse, Apocalypse proclaiming that ""everything they've built will fall"". As Apocalypse gathers his Four Horsemen and gives them special armor, Erik is contacted telepathically by Charles Xavier through Cerebro. En Sabah Nur notices the communication and uses his powers to take over Xavier's mind, and by extension Cerebro. Apocalypse forces military around the world to launch Earth's entire nuclear arsenal into space so it cannot be used against him. After Havok destroys Cerebro with his powers, Apocalypse and the horsemen teleport to the X-Mansion to kidnap Xavier. Havok's attempt at attacking Apocalypse ends hitting a generator and causes a massive explosion that destroys the mansion, with everyone inside except for Havok only surviving due to Quicksilver's intervention. En Sabah Nur - Apocalypse.png Apocalypse destroys almost all of the city of Cairo, killing thousands. Xavier is brought by En Sabah Nur to Cairo and forced to broadcast a threatening message to all the human race on the behalf of Apocalypse. Without En Sabah Nur knowing, Xavier also revealed his location in a hidden telepathic message to his student Jean Grey. En Sabah Nur destroyed most of Cairo to rebuild his pyramid, and ordered Magneto to stand outside it using his powers to control Earth's magnetic poles, causing widespread destruction across the planet and mass casualties. Meanwhile, inside the pyramid En Sabah Nur would transfer his consciousness to Xavier's body, as the telepath's powers would allow him to ""be everywhere, be everyone"". Apocalypse strangles Mystique. The X-Men arrive during the process, and Nightcrawler interrupts the transferal by teleporting Xavier out of the pyramid, much to Apocalypse's frustration, but not before Professor X loses his hair. As Apocalypse steps outside the pyramid, he witnesses Angel's death, calling him useless, before being repeatedly punched in the face by Quicksilver, who uses his super speed to not be noticed; however, En Sabah Nur is uninjured and soon adapts, trapping one of the speedster's feet to the ground, before breaking Peter's arm and leg. As Psylocke comes closer, he requests for her to execute Peter. Instead she strikes En Sabah Nur on the neck, and seeing it is not his Horseman, he proceeds to attack and strangle the mutant, revealed as a disguised Mystique. Apocalypse battles all of the X-Men at the same time. He orders Xavier to reveal his location, and the telepath goes on to attack Apocalypse at the Astral Plane. Although Xavier is able to overpower him at first, enough so that Apocalypse releases his grip on Mystique, En Sabah Nur quickly gains controls and finds Xavier's hideout. However, his attempt at getting there is interrupted by Magneto, who, seeing the errors of his ways and refusing to let his former friends die, switches sides. While the X-Men fight Apocalypse, Jean ventures into the astral plane and learns from Xavier that Apocalypse is physically weakened after centuries in the same body. Jean and Magneto join forces and dismantle Apocalypse's armor, with Jean tapping into the Phoenix Force. Once the Phoenix Force was unleashed, En Sabah Nur screamed in immense pain as his frail true form is exposed, Magneto pierces him with a tremendous torrent of high-speed metal projectiles, Cyclops fires his laser beam. Realizing he is outmatched, and in immense pain, En Sabah Nur attempts to teleport away; however, Storm, shocked by her leader's harsh words towards Angel following his death and his brutality towards Mystique and Quicksilver, also switches sides and uses lightning to prevent him from leaving. As a dying En Sabah Nur looks up at the Phoenix Force, he proclaims that ""all is revealed"" to Jean Grey. He then finally accepts his death as his fate, after which Phoenix incinerates him into dust, finally ending the threat for good.","Apocalypse could generate an extremely durable, yellow-hued energy shield around himself, able to withstand the combined attacks of Storm's lightning, Cyclops's optical blasts, and Magneto's tremendous torrent of high-speed metal projectiles.

She often rode around with her then boyfriend Slim Smith.In her first recorded adventure, Annie and Slim sought to have their horses reshoed by blacksmith Pete Grimm. Grimm, an unabashed woman hater refused to service Annie's horse. As fate would have it he was robbed just moments later right in front of them. Annie rode off the with the gang and used her female charm to lure each gang member away and knock them out and recover Grimm's stolen valuables. Annie's action changed Pete's opinion of women prompting him to offer free services to all women Soon after, Annie exposed land developer Josiah Cleek as a fraud when she revealed his new development of Sterling Wells was a shoddy operation In another town, Annie was accused of being the leader of a gang that was apparently led by a woman. Annie broke out of jail and tracked down the gang. She got the jump on their leader and turned them over to the authorities.

106,Attuma,Attuma,,12,"The barbarian warlord known as Attuma was part of a sect of Homo mermanus, part of the Skarka Tribe that was exiled from the city of Atlantis some time ago, likely over their opposition of the royal ruling class. Prophecies spoke that a warrior would be born from the Skarka who would conquer Atlantis by force. Before Attuma was even born, his tribe was captured by the barbarian warrior Rorak. He had heard of the prophecy and sought to rule Atlantis by controlling the warrior's fate. Attuma was born during the battle, but his mother didn't survive. Attuma kept a clot of her blood from her heart. When Rorak saw this, he was so impressed that he spared the child's life. However, Attuma was put into slavery for years allong all women and children of his tribe. But while others grew weak and died, Atuma thrived working on the mines. The young Attuma soon grew strong, cunning and ruthless. Later as a youth, Attuma led his fellow Skarka to an uprising that slaughtered Rorak's minions while Rorak himself fled. This group then settled in an area of the ocean referred to as the ""Murky Depths"". This society, too, prophesied that one of their own would one day overthrow the throne of Atlantis. From that moment on, Attuma was told by his people that he would be that person and since then he has lived by the sword. Through the years, Attuma grew to be the most powerful of his people, his ruthlessness cementing him as their leader. Atuma transformed the Skarka Tribe into an army of thousands from the Murky Depths, leading his tribe on a path of violent conquest.At some point in his adult life, Attuma sired a number of children. His first born was Andromeda with Lady Gelva, an Atlantean aristocrat allied with Attuma whom the warlord personally despised. Andromeda shamed Attuma for being female. Nonetheless, Attuma had the girl trained to be a warrior as though she were Attuma's son. Andromeda sought to prove herself by joining the Atlantean Army that opposed her father. The fate of his other children are unknown, however its possible they were estranged from their father in much the same way Andromeda was.",,95,65,55,75,100,80,"['Adaptation', 'Agility', 'Cold Resistance', 'Durability', 'Endurance', 'Energy Resistance', 'Enhanced Hearing', 'Enhanced Memory', 'Enhanced Senses', 'Enhanced Sight', 'Enhanced Smell', 'Enhanced Touch', 'Fire Resistance', 'Heat Resistance', 'Invulnerability', 'Reflexes', 'Stamina', 'Sub-Mariner', 'Super Speed', 'Super Strength', 'Toxin and Disease Resistance', 'Underwater breathing']",[],[''],,,Marvel Comics,,,,[],,,,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/11265.jpg?v=1577313247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
115,Banshee (FOX),Sean Cassidy,,7,"Banshee is first seen hitting on a girl in an aquarium. However, she doesn't accept him, and actually finds him comical. In a final attempt to gain her affection, Banshee uses his ability to scare away all of the fish. It doesn't work, and at this point, Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr appear, and convince Banshee to join the X-Men off screen. Later, Banshee is seen at the government facility with the rest of the X-Men. Banshee, Darwin, Angel, Beast, Mystique, and Havok are all seen getting to know each other, while also being taunted by several government agents who don't accept Banshee and the rest of the mutants. Then, around this time, Sebastian Shaw and the rest of The Hellfire Club attack the facility and kill several of the agents. Shaw, Azazel, and Riptide corner the young members of the X-Men. Shaw tires to convince them all to join him, and, much to the X-Men's horror, Angel does. Darwin, in an attempt to save Angel and kill Shaw, pretends to join The Hellfire Club. However, this fails, and Shaw kills Darwin by transferring Havok's energy into Darwin's body, causing Darwin's body to explode right in front of the X-Men. Banshee is next seen with the rest of the X-Men, mourning Darwin. Xavier is hesitant about continuing to lead the team, but Banshee helps manage to convince Xavier to continue to lead them, telling him that he doesn't want to see Havok go back to prison. So, Xavier takes Banshee and the rest of the X-Men to his home, the X-Mansion. There, Banshee and the rest of his team train for combat against Shaw and the Hellfire Club. While standing out in the courtyard with Charles and Moira, Charles helps him focus his power and he shatters a glass window, Charles tells him to go at a higher frequency and it gives Moira and Charles nausea. Beast designs a wingsuit for Banshee, intending for Banshee to use his sonic screaming to propel himself through the air. At first, Banshee is nervous about using his suit, and falls out of a window in a failed attempt at flying. Later, however, Banshee is seen standing at the top of a satellite dish, along with Charles, Erik, and Hank. Reluctant to jump and try to fly, Banshee claims that he is afraid of dying, at which point Erik pushes him. Banshee screams in terror, which generates loud enough sound waves for him to fly, helping Banshee to gain confidence and master his new ability. Banshee's ability of flight proves to be extremely useful during the fight against the Hellfire club later on, as he rises out of the water (after using his sonic screaming as sonar in order to locate Sebastian Shaw's submarine) and uses his scream against Tempest, disorienting her and saving Havok's life. Tempest flies after him though, and she burns a hole in his wing suit, causing Banshee and Havok to fall onto the beach. After this, Banshee and the rest of the mutants witness Erik expose Shaw's body and attempt to destroy all of the ships on the coast. Moira MacTaggert, however, tried to stop Erik by shooting at him. Erik blocked the bullets, but one rebounded and hit Charles in the back, resulting in his paralysis. When Banshee and the rest of the X-Men attempted to intervene, Erik used his ability to throw Banshee and the others backwards onto the beach. Then, after Erik and his newly formed Brotherhood of Mutants leave the beach, Banshee (along with Beast and Havok) run to Charles and Moira, who are both lying in the sand, as Charles is now paralyzed.",Banshee has the mutant ability to create powerful sonic waves with his voice with which he could achieve various effects.,90,10,25,35,35,70,"['Echolocation', 'Enhanced Hearing', 'Flight', 'Sonic Scream']","['Banshee', 'Death Seed Banshee']",[''],,,Marvel Comics,,,,[],,,,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/14366.jpg?v=1553975159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Starting with smaller crimes such as pickpocketing, and working his way up to larger felonies, he developed his own methodically written ""black book"" which contains a complete listing of everything a criminal must do to succeed, as well as a contingency plan for every situation. However, he knew it was inevitable that eventually he was going to have to fight local superhero Green Lantern. A brilliant inventor, he constructed a device that would allow him to absorb and harness quantities of the power ring radiation, and use it back against Green Lantern.[1] After Infinite Crisis, his beginnings were altered during Green Lantern: Secret Origin. It was revealed that his family had owned a funeral home, and that from a young age he had been completely obsessed with death. Although he tried to hide his obsession with taxidermy, after he killed and stuffed the family dog, he was taken to see a psychiatrist. While no psychological professional was capable of helping him get over his obsession, he learned to pretend normalcy and at least hide his problems. It is implied that during this time, he engaged in some acts of necrophilia.[2] His life changed forever when an alien monster Atrocitus, an enemy of the Guardians of the Universe, sought him out. Atrocitus is shown to be responsible for creating the weapon Black Hand is most famous for, William having stolen it afterward. Believing Hand's insides held the doorway to darkness, and wanting to control that power, Atrocitus attacked him, but was stopped by Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and Sinestro. Afterward, a mysterious voice in his head told him to take the weapon, and flee.[3] Shortly afterward, he would commit his first murder by accident... and like it.[4] He became obsessed with erasing the unbearable light of Green Lantern, and turned it into his life's mission. Fashioning a homemade costume out of body bags to remind him of his family and his identity, he prepared to fight the hero.[2] William Hand calls himself Black Hand as a reference to himself being the ""black sheep"" of the Hand family.[1] Black Hand The first time his mettle was professionally tested by Green Lantern, Black Hand used a device of his invention to transport the hero to an astral plane, piece by piece. Although he was only able to reduce Green Lantern by half, he took advantage of the stalemate between their powers to rob the city blind. Meanwhile, he attended a gala for the success of his three brothers to gloat over how much greater than them he had become.  Black Hand 024 First fight with Green Lantern. More famous than his brother Peter the actor, more brilliant than his brother Joe the scientist, and wealthier than his brother David the financier. Green Lantern managed to surprise him using a trick with mirrors, gained the upper hand, defeated and arrested Black Hand for the first time. It would not be the last.[1] Using his ability to mimic any of his foe's abilities, he would later cloud the minds of the citizens of Coast City to make them believe that Green Lantern was in fact a supervillain, which led to GL's arrest. Escaping from prison with the help of Pieface, Green Lantern challenged Black Hand again. When they both simultaneously ran out of charge, they engaged in fisticuffs which resulted in a massive knockout and Black Hand getting his ass spread out on the pavement.[5] Black Hand 020 Conspiracy The next time the two fought, Black Hand was responsible for a cabal that was mass-brainwashing a small town to do their bidding under the guise of a plastics manufacturing plant. After Green Lantern saved the town from a false natural disaster, he was drugged and kidnapped, without his power ring. Black Hand brainwashed the townspeople into believing GL was responsible, and intended to enjoy watching them lynch him and his girlfriend Carol Ferris. They were rescued by Green Arrow with a fresh recharge, and Black Hand was defeated once again shortly afterward.[6] Black Hand next appeared in Central City to challenge the Flash. He planned to siphon off the scarlet speedster's aura, and use it to make him completely invulnerable even to the traditional weaknesses associated with the Green Lantern Ring. Although Black Hand believed himself to have burned the Flash alive by taking away his resistance to friction, Flash escaped into his own ring. Later, the Flash knocked the villain out by tricking him into getting hit with his own beam.[7] When he next ran into his arch-nemesis, Black Hand was in jail. Green Lantern had been unjustly incarcerated for ""harassing"" Goldface and his minions, well-known criminals.[8] Goldface paid Black Hand off to start a riot, and lead his fellow inmates in murdering Green Lantern in prison. After a brutal rumble in which GL was nearly beaten to death, he was finally able to overcome the forces against him when at the last second he received his recharged ring from Tom Kalmaku. Black Hand was defeated, his device broken again, and thrown back into his cell.[9] After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, more members of the Green Lantern Corps were stationed on Earth. In the middle of a press conference, John Stewart, Katma Tui, Kilowog, Salakk and Ch'p caught him attempting to break into a bank. Rather than be intimidated, Black Hand absorbed power from all of their rings, making him nearly as powerful as five lanterns put together. Although he was stronger than all of them together, he was finally defeated again when Kilowog tricked him into wasting his charge and then beat the tar out of him with his bare hands.[10] Black Hand 042 Guy Gardner Following this last encounter, he decided to go straight, seek psychiatric care and enter legitimate business. He began running his own bawdy movie house in New York City. He was even considering turning it into an art house. However, a chance encounter with Guy Gardner and his girlfriend Ice triggered Hand back into his old costumed identity to fight superheroes once again. After trying to kill Gardner, he realized he was no longer up to the fight, and showed remorse. After Gardner kicked his butt, he surrendered, and was knocked unconscious.[11] This emotional breakdown convinced him to begin seeking professional help once again, as he was diagnosed ""hero-phobic"". Unfortunately, when he was finally back from his stay in a mental care facility, he had his recovery dinner at the same restaurant where several members of Justice League International were eating. Seeing Martian Manhunter, Kilowog and G'nort threw him into another ""episode"" and attacked the heroes. Afterward, he was forced to go into further therapy.[12] Eventually, he made a full recovery and went back into his regular career as a costumed supervillain. While he was running an illegitimate massage parlor in Times Square, he fought Guy Gardner again, and was able to beat the hero up while both of them were depowered; albeit with the help of his minions. Later, when Gardner was trying out a new way he could fight crime, he shot up the entire place with a massive arsenal of guns and Hand was revealed to still be seeing a psychiatric professional.[13] Eventually, Green Lantern turned evil and became Parallax during Emerald Twilight, destroying both the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians of the Universe.[14] When he nearly destroyed the universe in Zero Hour,[15] and later died sacrificing himself to save earth from the Sun-Eater in Final Night,[16] Black Hand finally felt a sense of relief. The light he had been working to extinguish for his entire life was finally put out, with little more than a mere spark remaining.[2] During Underworld Unleashed, when the villains of the world were called down to Hell and offered vastly increased powers in exchange for their immortal souls, Black Hand was apparently one of those who refused Neron's offer.[17] He was also involved in kidnapping the Mist's daughter, in an effort to blackmail her into stealing a government device for him. This time he was thwarted by Mary Marvel.[18] Later, he showed up back in Central City again as part of a vast underground criminal network being run by Blacksmith and her new Rogues.[19] Infinite Crisis Shortly before Hal Jordan's resurrection in Green Lantern: Rebirth, Black Hand's device located a spare Power Ring that Green Arrow held in case of emergency. Hand tried to claim the ring for himself, but was stopped by Green Arrow and Hal Jordan, who at that point was the current Spectre.  Black Hand 004 Crippled by the Spectre As Hand attempted to wield the power ring, the emerald archer pinned the villain's hand to the wall with an arrow and the Spectre burnt his hand to ash, stating ""(now) he can live up to his name"".[20] Now missing his right hand and driven insane from trauma, Hand fled. However, after hearing of Hal Jordan's resurrection, he decided to relocate to the rebuilt Coast City to take revenge on his old foe. While on board an airplane, he is targeted and abducted by the Kroloteans, a race of mysterious German-speaking aliens, who are akin to the gremlins of myth. They performed experiments that enhanced his inherent power, and abandon him in a public park. As he soon pieced together the mystery of his new powers, he went to a nearby hospital and drained the lifeforce from twenty two people, completely reforming his hand.[21] Black Hand 003 New Powers Locating the Green Lantern onboard the Kroloteans spaceship, Hand began draining the life from the Green Lantern, with his power ring being unable to stop the attack, only slow it down. As he continued to drain his foe, Hand ranted that Jordan had cheated death, something people were not allowed to do. Their fight spilled into the graveyard where Hal had saved him from Atrocitus, and Jordan was able to slice off Black Hand's newly reformed Hand and leave him in a grave, saying that death was nothing without life. Hand continued that death was stronger, and black was the most wonderful color in the universe.[22] He has since resurfaced from the Infinite Crisis, one of the several heroes and villains observed by Superman and Superman-Prime, and resurfaced.[23] While being transported to prison, Black Hand experiences a sudden power surge, killing his guards in the detonation and teleporting him to what appears to be the Black Lantern Central Power Battery. Blackest Night Main article: Blackest Night Somehow returning to Earth after the Final Crisis, Black Hand was lounging in an open grave with some skeletons when he began hearing the voice of the Guardian of Death, the being who formed the Black Lantern on Ryut. The voice began speaking the names of various heroes who had died and come back to life, including Jordan, Superman, Wonder Woman, Kilowog, Flash and Kid Flash. Returning to his family home, Hand murdered each member of his family one by one before finally turning his cosmic diving rod on himself. Scar, who also worshiped the Guardian of Death, made a Black Lantern Ring which reanimated Black Hand, dubbing the herald of their lord.[24] Heading to Gotham City, Hand recited the Black Lantern oath and dug up the skull of Batman.[25] Following this, the Guardian of Death released thousands of Black rings from the Central Battery, heading for Earth and Oa. Among those added to the Black Lantern Corps were former Justice Leaguers J'onn J'onzz, Ralph and Sue Dibny. J'onn was sent after Hal and Barry Allen, while the Dibnys were sent after Hawkman and Hawkgirl, who had been in a cycle of death and reincarnation for over three thousand years. The Dibnys murdered the Hawks, and Black Hand sent rings from Batman's skull to add them to the Black Lantern Corps.[26] Black Hand remained largely absent during the initial power build up for the Black Lanterns, waiting in Coast City for when the Black Lanterns power levels reached 100%. He did observe the taking of the Spectre and noted that the Phantom Stranger did not register on the Black Lanterns emotional readout as living or dead, something which interested him.[27] Finally, once the power levels reached 100%, Black Hand beheld the arrival of the Black Central Battery's from Ryut to Coast City, then commanded Nekron, the Guardian of Death, to ""RISE"".[28] Black Hand helps Nekron battle the heroes of Earth and the Lantern Corps. In the final issue of Blackest Night it is revealed that Black Hand is Nekron's link to the living plane. This prompts Hal Jordan to bond with the white entity of life and use it's power to resurrect Black Hand, destroying Nekron's link to the living plane, and causing the villain's defeat. Indigo 1 takes Black Hand to the Indigo Tribe's home world. He appears to be dazed and confused. Brightest Day Black Hand comes back to Earth with the Indigo Tribe in order to assist in gathering the emotional entities. It is revealed that the coalesced compassion channeled by the Tribe has altered him into a being who's focused on caring for the well being of others","Powers and Abilities Powers Life-Force Absorption: Following the actions of extraterrestrials who subjected him to experimentation, he now has a means to recreate his hand. The experiments granted Black Hand the ability to consume the life-force of the living to create a new hand for himself. The amount of life-force he consumes relates to the amount of time he can control the limb. Cosmic Awareness Black Energy Conduit: The Black Lantern Rings are capable of wielding the black energy outside of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum. Black Energy Constructs: Black Lantern Rings can create constructs, but they are seldom created, except when the Black Lantern used to wield such abilities or certain weapons. Arnold Wesker created a construct of Scarface upon his receiving a ring, and the Black Lanterns created from former Lanterns of other colors also can use them in this fashion.[2] Flight: Black Lantern Rings can allow their users to fly. Reanimation: Upon latching onto a corpse, the Black Lantern ring will reanimate the body. The ring animating the person within downloads all the memories and superhuman abilities (if they had any) of their previous life, but not their souls. Instead, they are malevolent beings who seek to murder even those they considered friends. Regeneration: Black Lantern Rings will regenerate destroyed limbs to complete the appearance of the corpse.[3] It is possible for the rings to fully regenerate the host to the point that they appear alive, but the rings usually settle for a decayed appearance to terrify the target. Black Lantern emotion vision A reading of the emotions of four separate beings, namely Carol Ferris, Hal Jordan, Sinestro and Indigo. Emotional Reading: The Black Lantern rings are capable of scanning a being's current emotional state and where it falls onto the Emotional Spectrum. They then attack the beings and attempt to remove their hearts. When facing beings with warped mental states, or otherwise addled minds (such as Bizarro), the correlation between the emotion detected and the actual color that the Black Lanterns see is inverted. Once removed, the hearts are converted to energy. A single heart equals 0.01% of the power needed to fully charge the Black Lantern battery, and this is apparently shared throughout the rings of the entire Black Lantern Corps. [4] When the power levels finally reached 100.00%, it enabled the Black Central Battery to teleport to Coast City and allow Nekron to move from his dimension into this plane of existence.[5] Life Extinguishing: The Black Lantern rings are capable of taking hold of a person who had been killed and resurrected, putting them under their control, effectively killing them again. This was shown when a group of resurrected heroes, including Superman, Superboy, Ice and Kid Flash, were possessed by the rings when they latched on and were commanded to ""Die"". [6] One of those affected, Superboy-Prime, is an interesting case - while he has never technically died, Prime was still affected by it, though he was still in control. Emotional Spectrum Mimicry: Somehow, the Black Lantern rings can mimic the Emotional Spectrum of the other rings. This was shown when, upon taking a Black Lantern ring, Superboy-Prime attacked other Black Lanterns, lashing out with most of the spectrum, save Hope, which was used by Prime's girlfriend. [7] Darkness Manipulation: Black rings can generate a light devouring field of depleted photons causing a massive black out effect which negates or greatly weakens the power of the Emotional Spectrum.[8] Spectrum Nullification: A black Lantern Ring can extinguish the light of the Emotional spectrum cutting off a ring wielders power rings connection to their specific empathic energy field.[9] Empathic Absorption: Black Lantern Rings can also be used to leech off the raw emotion spectrum energy of another ring, as was the case with Aquaman when he siphoned off Jessica's Will Power energy from her ring Abilities Genius Level Intellect: Black Hand spent years compiling a book that contained the solution to any possible problem a criminal could run into, and his photographic memory enabled him to recall every piece of information in it. Weaknesses Life-Force Depletion: As an after-effect of the experimentation, when he has not consumed enough life-force, he assumes burnt or decaying appearance. Mental Illness: The physical and psychological trauma of losing his hand, coupled with years of defeat by various superheroes, has left William Hand mentally unstable. White Light of Creation: As expressions of darkness, the Black Lantern rings are vulnerable to the white light that represents life. Eons ago, the darkness splintered the white light into the seven lights of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum. Individually, the seven lights are unable to harm the Black Lanterns, but the green light of willpower, representing all sentient life, working with one or more of the other six, can render the Black Lantern rings inert and leave the Black Lanterns vulnerable to conventional attacks. The black rings can also have their connections severed by the white power contained within Dawn Granger. Black Lantern Holly Granger was visibly hurt when she attempted to rip out her heart, and the ensuing blast of light severed the connections of an attacking group of Black Lanterns. Emotion: As beings whose entire power is concentrated around the idea of lacking all emotions, they are extremely vulnerable to potent artifacts intended to force emotions upon the victim, such as the Medusa Mask. It is also possible that living beings, or at least ones filled with virtually every emotion can take control of the Black Lantern ring, as Superboy-Prime was still in control of himself when he lashed out at other Black Lanterns. Time Travel: Oddly, Black Lantern Rings, though shown to possess enough speed to follow even The Flash, cannot follow anyone fast enough to travel through time, as Barry Allen demonstrated, shifting himself and Hal Jordan a few seconds ahead into the future and causing the ring to lose them",95,90,85,75,100,75,"['Accelerated Healing', 'Animation', 'Astral Trap', 'Biokinesis', 'Clairvoyance', 'Cold Resistance', 'Darkforce Manipulation', 'Death Touch', 'Dimensional Awareness', 'Durability', 'Endurance', 'Energy Absorption', 'Energy Beams', 'Energy Blasts', 'Energy Constructs', 'Flight', 'Force Fields', 'Grim Reaping', 'Heat Resistance', 'Immortality', 'Insanity', 'Intelligence', 'Lantern Power Ring', 'Latent Abilities', 'Mind Control Resistance', 'Power Nullifier', 'Regeneration', 'Resurrection', 'Self-Sustenance', 'Stamina', 'Summoning', 'Super Speed', 'Super Strength', 'Teleportation']",[],"['Wilbur Palm, Black Glove, Entity']","Coastville , California",Green Lantern (vol. 2) #29 (June 1964),DC Comics,,Leader of Black Lanterns,Sector 666,"['Black Lantern Corps', 'Black Lantern Corps']","David Hand

199,Blackwulf,Lucian,Lucian,5,"  Lucian was the fourth child born to Tantalus and Nirvana on Armechadon, but while his siblings had been, to various degrees, genetically perfect, Lucian was born with a birthmark, signifying his father's Black Legacy. Nirvana killed herself the evening Tantalus was to journey to earth, to prevent herself from giving birth to any more monsters. Tantalus brought Lucian with him to earth, where he was exiled by the Celestials. Tantalus treated Lucian with contempt because of his birthmark, and had low regard for his abilities.   Lucian was sent alongside Schizo and Bristle to escort Pandara back to Lyonesse, but along the way, had to fight through the rebel leader Blackwulf, Thunderstrike, Stellaris, and Code: BLUE. When Code: BLUE rallied against them, Lucian was convinced by Schizo and Bristle to retreat, abandoning Pandara.   Lucian trained against his brother Pelops, and again lost to him in battle, no great surprise to Tantalus. Tantalus sent Lucian to lead the Peacekeepers in recovering the human scientist Dr. Caitlin Maddox, a genetic researcher who might be able to stablize the Deviant genetic code. However, Lucian's mission was interrupted by the arrival of the Underground Legion, and he fought their leader Blackwulf. In the course of battle, Lucian suspected he was battling his own brother, Pelops. Ultimately, the Underground escaped with Dr. Maddox.   Later, Pelops returned to Lyonesse and revealed himself to Lucian as Blackwulf. He dared Lucian to kill him, but Lucian couldn't. However, Tantalus overheard this treachery and slew Pelops himself, hoping that this would teach Lucian a valuable lessson. Instead, Lucian vowed to destroy his father, and adopted the name of Blackwulf for himself.   Blackwulf attempted to inform the Peacekeepers of what had happened to Pelops, but they dismissed his accusations against Tantalus. Lucian therefore sought out the Underground Legion, and presented himself to them as their new member. They distrusted Lucian immediately, but he proved his worth to them as they fought the Peacekeepers over the bodies of two dead Skrulls at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. However, the Peacekeepers escaped with one of the bodies, and the Underground was forced to flee from arriving soldiers. Taking to the air in a stealth fighter, they were shot down by the villain Scorch.   Wildwind was seemingly killed in the crash. Blackwulf battled Scorch in the wreckage of the fighter and was able to match his power, but he and the Underground were forced to surrender when reinforcements arrived for Scorch. They were imprisoned at the base.   Blackwulf was set free by Dr. Maddox and the Prime Skrull, and while the others departed, he went back to retrieve Wildwind's body. Scorch was waiting for him, and the two fought over her body, with Blackwulf ultimately triumphing. To his surprise, the rest of the Underground waited for him to return, and they set back to their base.   Blackwulf joined the Underground and Giant-Man in following Sparrow to Ottsville, Pennsylvania, where she had disappeared on assignment. They found that the people of Ottsville had been taken over by living circuitry devised by Ultron, and that Sparrow herself was under Ultron's control. Mammoth broke Ultron's control over Sparrow by telling her that Lucian had killed Pelops, and how he was now the new Blackwulf. Sparrow attacked Blackwulf, but was brought to her senses. The Underground and Giant-Man were unable to capture Ultron, but Blackwulf defeated Sentry#459, and Giant-Man mended some of Ultron's damage by making the people of Ottsville believe that they had been restored to full humanity.   Blackwulf returned to the mansion with the Underground, and Sparrow started another fight with him, still holding him responsible for Pelops' death. Blackwulf had an opportunity to kill her with his Black Legacy, and she welcomed it. At this, Blackwulf stood down, disgusted by her lack of emotion. He told her how Pelops' last words had been that he loved her-- but Lucian didn't think she deserved such love. He then left the Underground.   Blackwulf set off into the streets of New York, brushing against common humanity for the first time. When a vendor offered him a hot dog, he accepted it, not understanding the use of money. A woman also had a proposition for him, and he was shocked that humans even charged money for that. When a man's car was stolen, Blackwulf tried to help by hurling his Shadowlance at it, but he destroyed the car in the process, upsetting the owner. Just then, the Celestial creation the Godstalker appeared, having mistaken Blackwulf for his father Tantalus, for it could not believe that Tantalus could ever produce offspring. Blackwulf fought back against it, proclaiming his innocence, but the Godstalker had him far outmatched, and broke the Shadowlance in half. He was saved by the arrival of Sparrow, who used the halves of the Shadowlance to defeat the Godstalker. Blackwulf awoke in Sparrow's apartment, but he quickly realized that the Godstalker could not have been destroyed-- just as it assaulted the building!   Blackwulf fought the Godstalker side-by-side with Sparrow, but the Godstalker teleported the two of them into another dimension to battle him there.   Sparrow was able to access the dimension Blackwulf was in with the aid of Khult, and brought him his Shadowlance, rebuilt and made into a fourth-dimensional weapon by Khult. By channeling positive energy, Blackwulf was able to slice the Godstalker into ribbons, but even then it still existed. However, the Godstalker now believed Lucian's claim of being Tantalus' son, and decreed that it would be his duty to destroy Tantalus. So saying, the Godstalker bonded to the Shadowlance, making it even more powerful. However, as a result of this bonding process, Blackwulf was cured of his Black Legacy, removing his birthmark.   Lucian learned from S.H.I.E.L.D. databases held by the Underground Legion that Deathlok, a cyborg from an alternate reality, came from a world in which Pelops was still alive, and Tantalus had converted to the side of good. Lucian determined to seek Deathlok out to learn more about his reality.   Just as Lucian caught up with Deathlok in a series of underground tunnels where he was assisted homeless people against the Sewer King alongside Daredevil, Lucian put aside his questions to aid the homeless from bombs planted down there by Walter Jenkins. Lucian saved Deathlok from being slain by one of the bombs, which annoyed the cyborg. Finally able to ask him his questions, Lucian was told by Manning that nothing he could tell Lucian would change a thing in his world, because their fates had already been sealed. Lucian asked Deathlok to join the Underground Legion, but Deathlok replied that he had to sort himself out first before he could be of use to anyone.   Apparently brought to Armechadon by Khult, Blackwulf joined the Underground in battling Tantalus and his Peacekeepers, and found himself reunited with his mother, Nirvana. Wishing to end her suffering, no matter the cost to himself, Blackwulf absorbed the Black Legacy which surrounded her into himself, regaining his birthmark but setting her life free. Blackwulf then attacked his father, and recalling instructions from Khult, focused on positive energies. Blackwulf absorbed his father's Black Legacy into himself, with the result of temporarily displacing his father's ego. However, as a result, Lucian was transformed so that now his skin was ebon black. ","Lucian inherited his father's Black Legacy, a form of energy which can instantly slay life upon contact. The black legacy is represented upon Lucian at all times as a birthmark stripe along the left side of his face, and transforms the left side of his face completely black when the power is employed. Lucian also channels the Black Legacy through his choice weapon, the Shadowlance. Lucian also possesses enhanced strength and durability.",75,30,10,30,70,25,"['Death Touch', 'Durability', 'Energy Blasts', 'Super Strength']",[],"['Pelops, Black Wolf']",Armechadon,"Thunderstrike #6 (March, 1994)",Marvel Comics,,Freedom Fighter,,[],"Tantalus (father); Nirvana (mother); Pelops (brother, deceased)",Male,Alien,6'2 • 188 cm,195 lb • 88 kg,Red,White,,/pictures2/portraits/10/050/1508.jpg?v=1314440763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

283,,,,-,"Dmitri Smerdyakov was the illegitimate son of the patriarch of the Russian Kravinoff family and a servant. His only friend growing up was Joe Cord, an American boy who once saved his life while his half-brother Sergei, the legitimate heir, and his father treated him with contempt and brutality. This scarred Dmitri so deeply that he repressed his very identity and came to believe he had been friends with Sergei instead. His loss of self led him to become a master of disguise and a Soviet spy. Initially without super-powers, the Chameleon relied on his skills and a mixture of costumes and make-up to conceal his identity. He wore a multi-pocket disguise vest in which he kept the materials he would need to mask himself at short notice.  In his first known appearance, Chameleon impersonated Professor Newton, a government scientist, to steal half of some missile defense plans. He then sent a message to Spider-Man, electronically contacting him via his spider-sense, requesting a meeting and implying a profitable venture. Chameleon disguised himself as Spider-Man, though, and stole the second half of the plans, making his escape just as the real wall-crawler showed up. Spidey was at first framed for the theft but managed to bring Chameleon back to the police. Chameleon disguised himself as a police officer, scaring Spider-Man off by having the other police attack him. Spidey left the scene, thinking he had failed, not realizing that he had torn Chameleon's police uniform, allowing the cops to see the phony Spider-Man outfit underneath.  Chameleon was deported back to Russia, but returned soon after, having given up being a spy, and turned instead to a life of crime. Stymied again by the wall-crawler, Chameleon invited his half-brother, now known as Kraven the Hunter, to America to capture Spider-Man. The duo worked together, with Chameleon even dressing as Kraven to fool Spidey. Ultimately, though, both were defeated and deported by freighter where they bribed a sailor to set them loose in a lifeboat near Long Island. They came ashore right by Tony Stark�s munitions factory and Kraven was quickly captured by Iron Man. Chameleon concealed his presence but decided to prove his superiority over Kraven by defeating the armored Avenger. Disguising himself as Captain America, Chameleon contacted Iron Man and convinced him that he was the real Captain America and that the Captain America at Avengers Mansion was really Chameleon. Iron Man and Captain America fought it out until Giant-Man captured Chameleon and revealed the truth.  Chameleon quickly escaped prison and went to work for the Leader as his top lieutenant. The Leader sent him to New Mexico to learn the secrets of the Hulk. There, Chameleon impersonated General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross and Dr. Bruce Banner, stole a grenade-size gamma bomb and took Betty Ross as a hostage. Realizing he couldn't escape, Chameleon set off the bomb, which was smothered by the Hulk, dampening the blast. Though caught in the rubble, Chameleon survived and escaped, remaining in the Leader's employ until his boss' supposed death.  Chameleon next encountered Spider-Man after taking the place of Captain George Stacy who had been hired to protect a valuable art exhibit at the Midtown Museum. Peter Parker and Stacy�s daughter Gwen were there and noticed that the Captain didn't seem to recognize them. After the exhibit was stolen and Stacy found drugged back at his apartment, Peter realized the Chameleon must have been involved. He persuaded Joe Robertson to plant a story in the Daily Bugle about a transfer of bonds and trapped Chameleon trying to steal them. Chameleon tried to escape through disguise but made the mistake of impersonating the one person Spider-Man knew to be a fake: Peter Parker. The terrorist organization Hydra arranged for Chameleon's escape from prison so that he could impersonate Dr. Henry Pym and steal Pym's research combating their biological weapon Virus Nine. Pym, as Ant-Man, teamed with the Hulk and thwarted Chameleon, though it appeared at the time that Chameleon had murdered Bruce Banner. Later, Chameleon impersonated Spider-Man, attempting to free his friend Joe Cord from the New York Men's Detention Center. Accidentally striking the Hulk with his car, Chameleon quickly disguised himself as Hulk's friend Rick Jones and convinced the green goliath to break Joe out of jail. However, in a battle with police, Joe protected Chameleon from gunfire and was killed.  Designing a new costume that could instantly duplicate any clothing, Chameleon went back to crime. He was pursued after a jewel heist by Torpedo (Brock Jones) and Daredevil. His quick-changes failed to help him since Daredevil tracked him by his heartbeat. His next costume innovation used a holographic belt that stored the appearances of people he came into contact with and allowed him to take on their look. In one encounter, he managed to convince people that Spidey had attacked an old lady, leaving the wall-crawler's newly restored reputation in tatters. Later he obtained further powers by using a serum that could let him change his appearance at will. This liquid actually allowed his skin to be flexible enough to shift its appearance into any disguise Chameleon desired. He tried to kidnap a top scientist but was again thwarted by Spider-Man.  Chameleon then set his sights on ruling the New York underworld. He kidnapped J. Jonah Jameson, impersonating him in a long-term bid to influence events through the Bugle, and formed an alliance with Hammerhead. The Kingpin of Crime was embroiled in a power struggle with the werewolf Lobo Brothers Carlos and Eduardo. Chameleon and Hammerhead tried to instigate a full-on gang war, from which they would pick up the pieces. Chameleon, posing as Jameson, injected Spider-Man with a potion that left him unconscious for several days. Recovering, Spider-Man went after Jameson and discovered he was the Chameleon all along. Hammerhead and Chameleon's plans continued as they ambushed the Lobo Brothers and Kingpin during peace talks. After carving up the city into territories they each agreed to control, their alliance collapsed and their influence waned.  Soon after, Chameleon took the guise of Doctor Turner and persuaded Spider-Man to subject himself to a machine that supposedly would analyze his spider-powers. The machine, designed by the Tinkerer, ended up temporarily removing the wall-crawler's abilities instead. After discussing it with Mary Jane, Spider-Man decided to have his powers removed permanently. Now powerless, Spidey was attacked by Tarantula (Luis Alvarez) and Scorpion and needed the Black Cat's help to survive. Changing his mind, Spider-Man searched for Doctor Turner, eventually realizing he was actually Chameleon, by which time his powers returned naturally. The Chameleon's next big plan was set up by the Green Goblin (Harry Osborn) before his death. The Goblin persuaded Chameleon to create two robots that would appear to be Peter Parker's dead parents in an effort to get Peter to tell them who Spider-Man really was. The Goblin already knew Spidey's identity but wanted to mess with Peter's head so he convinced Chameleon that Parker, due to all the photos he had taken, was sure to know Spidey's identity. When Spider-Man discovered the fraud, he went crazy with rage and disappointment at losing his parents again. The Chameleon escaped to Kraven's old mansion while Spider-Man hunted him down. Faced with a more fearsome and vicious Spider-Man than ever before, Chameleon's repressed memories of his unhappy childhood with Sergei returned and he fell into a coma-like state.  The Chameleon was taken to Ravencroft Institute but escaped after assuming the identity of his doctor, Ashley Kafka. He kidnapped Spider-Man and unmasked him, finally understanding why Spider-Man had been so mad after discovering the robot parents. Chameleon imprisoned Peter and convinced him he was a writer named Herbert Smith who was incarcerated in an insane asylum. Chameleon then took on the role of Peter himself but was foiled by Mary Jane, armed with a baseball bat, who knew her husband too well to fall for the impersonation. Escaping, he was shot by his nephew Alyosha Kravinoff, who said there could only be one Kravinoff in the world. Chameleon again barely survived. Later, he arranged to meet Spider-Man on top of the Brooklyn Bridge, wanting to make up for his crimes. There, he tried to commit suicide by jumping. Spider-Man blamed himself for this apparent death but Chameleon somehow survived. He was later recommitted to Ravencroft. In Chameleon�s twisted mind he now believes himself to be his half-brother, Kraven the Hunter. This didn�t stop him from joining Norman Osborn�s Sinister Twelve, however.",The Chameleon can instantly change his appearance and imitate others so convincingly that practically no one can tell the Chameleon and his victim apart. His natural talents are now augmented with a face-changing serum.,0,0,0,0,0,0,[],[],[''],,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,/pictures2/portraits/10/050/660.jpg?v=,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
294,Chosen Undead,,,21,"After becoming an undead the player character was imprisoned in the Northern Undead Asylum. They are rescued by Oscar of Astora, who drops a key into the player's cell so that they may be freed. After escaping from the Asylum Demon, they encounter a fatally wounded Oscar, who tells the player about a prophecy, stating that an undead shall partake in pilgrimage to ring the Bells of Awakening. Oscar gives the player an Estus Flask and dies in peace, trusting the Chosen Undead to take his place. After defeating the Asylum Demon, the Chosen Undead escapes the asylum and is flown to Lordran by a Giant Crow. Upon arriving in Lordran, the Giant Crow drops the Chosen Undead in Firelink Shrine, which acts as a hub for the player for the rest of the story. After hearing the location of the Bells of Awakening from the Crestfallen Warrior, the Chosen Undead sets out on their journey. Various characters can be encountered throughout Lordran, such as Solaire of Astora, a charismatic warrior seeking ""his own sun""; the treacherous knight Lautrec of Carim; and Siegmeyer of Catarina, an absent-minded knight who frequently finds himself in danger. On a rooftop in the Undead Parish, the player slays the Bell Gargoyles and manages to ring one of the bells. Later on, the player makes their way deep into the infested swamps of Blighttown. There, the player defeats the Chaos Witch Quelaag and rings the other bell. After ringing both bells, the gate to Sen's Fortress is opened. After passing the trials to ring the two bells, Kingseeker Frampt, a primordial serpent, appears to task the character with another quest before they are deemed worthy as Chosen. The player must go into the city of Anor Londo and retrieve the Lordvessel from Gwynevere, Lord Gwyn's daughter. In order to complete the quest the player needs to traverse Sen's Fortress, an old proving ground built by the gods. After passing through the fortress and its many dangerous traps, the player battles the Iron Golem, and with its defeat gains the entrance into the forsaken city. Once in Anor Londo, the player makes their way into the Anor Londo cathedral, where they face Dragonslayer Ornstein, of the Four Knights of Gwyn, and Executioner Smough. The Chosen Undead triumphs over them and gains access into the chamber of Gwynevere, where they are greeted by the Princess and awarded the Lordvessel. When Frampt sees that the player had completed their quest, he declares the prophecy set in motion and that the character is indeed the incarnation of the Chosen Undead. The player is given the choice to put the Lordvessel on the Firelink Altar and proceed along Frampt's designs. In this instance, Frampt prompts that the Chosen Undead is the hero destined to succeed Lord Gwyn and extend the Age of Fire, continuing the curse of the undead. The player is also given the choice to place the Lordvessel for another ancient serpent named Darkstalker Kaathe, an agent of the Darkwraiths. Following this path will bring about the eradication of the old gods, and usher in the Age of Dark. To gain access to Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, the Chosen Undead must satiate the Lordvessel. There are several beings who possess souls powerful enough to do so: Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, Seath the Scaleless and the Four Kings of New Londo. Four kings grab One of the Four Kings draining humanity from the Chosen Undead. In order to defeat the Four Kings, the Chosen Undead needs to acquire the Covenant of Artorias, a ring that is kept by the Great Grey Wolf Sif. The ring allows one to traverse the dark void called the Abyss. Upon arriving in the ruins of New Londo, the Chosen Undead, with the help of Ingward, drains the flooded city, earning passage to the Darkwraiths and their masters. If the player has not yet placed the Lordvessel before defeating the Four Kings, Darkstalker Kaathe will appear in the abyss. In The Duke's Archives the Chosen Undead confronts Seath the Scaleless, an albino dragon who betrayed the Ancient Dragons and won Lord Gwyn´s trust. During their first encounter, the Chosen Undead is unable to cause any harm to Seath and is captured. Seath imprisons the Chosen Undead inside his prison tower where the player cannot warp out from. Despite the inconveniences, the Chosen Undead eventually escapes. Later on, the Chosen Undead learns from Big Hat Logan that Seath is immortal due to an ancient artifact known as the Primordial Crystal, an old relic that Seath stole from the Ancient Dragons. The Chosen Undead then departs to the Crystal Cave, where the artifact lies, and shatters it. This annuls Seath's immortality, allowing the Chosen Undead to slay him. The Chosen Undead also travels to the Catacombs, where they defeat Pinwheel and acquire the Rite of Kindling. The Chosen Undead then descends into the Tomb of the Giants, where the scavenger, Trusty Patches tricks the player and kicks them off a cliff. The Chosen Undead survives and rescues Reah of Thorolund, a maiden who ventured into Nito's domain in search of the Rite of Kindling. Finally, the Chosen Undead advances toward the deepest part of the area: Gravelord Nito's tomb. There, they finish off the conductor of death. Lastly, the Chosen Undead advances into the deepest part of Lordran: Lost Izalith. If the player speaks to Quelana in Blighttown it will be discovered that her mother tried to use her power to replicate the First Flame, but failed and was engulfed within it; eventually succeeding but at the cost of their former forms. This killed some of her daughters in the process and turned others into deformed creatures, and only Quelana and a Daughter of Chaos maintained the entirety of their human forms. Within the city, the Chosen Undead comes upon the Bed of Chaos, the source of all the demons that wander Lordran, and overcomes it. After offering the necessary Lord Souls, the doors to the Kiln of the First Flame are opened to the Chosen Undead. Gwyn, now reduced to a Lord of Cinder, breathes his last breath in the final confrontation with the Chosen Undead. It is here that the Chosen Undead may make their decision of either linking the flame or walking away from it. Depending on which course of action is taken, one of the two possible endings will be unlocked. Whether the player has aligned themselves with Kaathe or Frampt will not affect the ending of the game. Link the Fire: This ending is unlocked if the player rekindles the First Flame. The Chosen Undead offers themselves as kindling to the fire. Sacrificing all of their souls, the Chosen Undead is consumed by the flames and the Age of Fire is extended, as life is breathed into the First Flame once more. Dark Lord: This ending is unlocked if the player leaves the arena after killing Lord Gwyn. Upon leaving, the Chosen Undead is greeted by the Primordial Serpents, who bow down before their Dark Lord. Rejecting the Age of Fire, the Chosen Undead instead ushers in the Age of Dark, and becomes the ruler of a dying world.",,60,50,45,70,100,85,"['Agility', 'Cloaking', 'Cold Resistance', 'Darkforce Manipulation', 'Dexterity', 'Dimensional Travel', 'Durability', 'Electrokinesis', 'Endurance', 'Energy Absorption', 'Energy Blasts', 'Enhanced Memory', 'Fire Control', 'Fire Resistance', 'Illumination', 'Illusions', 'Immortality', 'Invisibility', 'Light Control', 'Magic', 'Magic Resistance', 'Marksmanship', 'Peak Human Condition', 'Reflexes', 'Regeneration', 'Resurrection', 'Self-Sustenance', 'Stamina', 'Stealth', 'Toxin and Disease Control', 'Toxin and Disease Resistance', 'Weapons Master', 'Weather Control', 'Wind Control']",[],[''],,,Namco,,,,[],,,,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/15205.jpg?v=1547939781,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
307,Cole,Cole,Cole,13,"As a child, Cole's father sent him to the Marty Oppenheimer School of Performing Arts hoping that he would follow in his footsteps and become a dancer. Unwilling to do so but reluctant to displease his father, Cole secretly ran away from the school, occasionally writing to his father to claim that he was still following the dancer's path. Cole began drifting from place to place, always seeking new challenges to test his strength and skill. Soon after his mother died, he attempted to climb the tallest mountain in Ninjago. Upon reaching the top, he found Master Wu sitting there, drinking tea. After telling Wu about his anger towards his father for ignoring him and ignoring the loss of his mother, he is told by Wu that grief is dealt with in many forms, sometimes with singing and dancing, and sometimes by climbing mountains. Cole proceeded to ask Wu why he climbed the mountain, after which he learned that Wu was there to meet him. Learning that he had great potential, he followed the old master to the Monastery of Spinjitzu and began training to become a Ninja.","Cole commands the element of Earth, giving him great physical strength and durability. He can stand his ground to a supernatural degree—enemies frequently act as though they have hit a person-shaped brick wall when they bump into him. At full power, he can manipulate the earth below his feet, causing earthquakes, creating fissures, throwing rocks and dust at enemies, or even burying things in rapidly-rising mounds of dirt. Like his fellow Ninja, he can also perform Spinjitzu and Airjitzu. After coming to terms with his dancing heritage, Cole gains a surprising amount of grace and flexibility, allowing him to wriggle out of tight spaces when he relaxes himself. His new agility also enables him to perform the Triple Tiger Sashay, which is effective against multiple opponents or for getting himself out of trouble. In battle, Cole favors scythes, especially the Scythe of Quakes. He later wields an Elemental Blade with the power of Earth, allowing him to use his elemental powers to great effect once more, he has also wielded a green techno blade attached to a flail allowing him to hack machines, an orange Aeroblade with the ability to destroy ghosts, he briefly used the yin blade to try to defeat Yang, and in Hands of Time he uses a longer scythe with two blades. In Season 8, Cole used a Hammer. After becoming a ghost, Cole obtains ghost powers such as possessing materials (like snow), objects (like a key hole), and mechanisms (like Zane's mech). He also has the ability to phase through solid objects, but become solid himself if he concentrates. This state does, however make him weak to water. He can also levitate, and turn invisible. However, upon becoming a mortal again, he has lost these abilities. After defeating Yang, Cole obtains superhuman strength, even more so then before. This is seen in use when his arms glow orange. Cole himself doesn't even know the extent of this new ability, nor is he an expert at controlling its power. At times, his hands appear to have a mind of their own when the power is activated. But overtime, he manages to control it and summon it at will.",70,50,50,80,100,100,"['Ability Shift', 'Accelerated Healing', 'Adaptation', 'Agility', 'Animal Control', 'Camouflage', 'Durability', 'Element Control', 'Endurance', 'Enhanced Senses', 'Enhanced Touch', 'Flight', 'Force Fields', 'Hacking', 'Intangibility', 'Invisibility', 'Latent Abilities', 'Matter Absorption', 'Matter Manipulation', 'Natural Armor', 'Non-Physical Interaction', 'Peak Human Condition', 'Power Augmentation', 'Reflexes', 'Seismic Power', 'Spinjitzu', 'Stealth', 'Summoning', 'Super Breath', 'Super Speed', 'Super Strength', 'The Force', 'Transformation', 'Weapon-based Powers', 'Weapons Master']",['Cole (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)'],['Ninja of earth'],Ninjago,Way of the ninja,Lego,,Royal Blacksmith (formerly)/ Elemental master of earth(actually),None,[],"Unnamed (grandfather)

355,Dark Elf Soldier,Dark Elf Soldier,,3,"The Dark Elf race originated in the Ginnungagap (""yawning abyss""), the vast, primordial darkness that existed prior to the creation of the manifest universe, where they reigned absolute and unchallenged. When the universe came into being and the other civilizations of the Nine Realms arose, the Dark Elves sought to return the universe to its former state of darkness. It was then that their leader, the sorcerer Malekith, engineered the Aether, a super weapon forged from the substance permeating and surrounding the universe before it came into being.The Asgardians, led by their then-king Bor, fought a fierce war with the Dark Elves, eventually driving them back to Svartalfheim as Malekith attempted to use the Aether. In that final battle, with the Convergence approaching, the Dark Elves fought with all of their might, utilizing their advanced technology as well as their elite troops, the Kursed, to attempt to halt the Asgardian advance. The Asgardians were able to triumph, however, launching an attack on Malekith and his bodyguards. During the struggle, the Aether was lost to Malekith, taken by the Asgardians via the Bifrost. His plans ruined, Malekith launched a final, suicidal attack on the Asgardians, dropping the Dark Elf ships out of the sky in an effort to crush all beneath them. Malekith himself escaped the battle, along with dozens of his kin and his lieutenant, Algrim, who would later become one of the Kursed himself. The battle caused the utter destruction of the rest of the Dark Elves, leaving those that escaped aboard Malekith's ship as the only survivors. Five thousand years later, as the Convergence neared again, Malekith attempted to use the Aether again. By this point, however, it had planted itself within the body of the human woman Jane Foster. Malekith led his kin in an attack on Asgard, where Thor had taken FosterUsing cloaking devices, Malekith's ship, along with a number of smaller ships, were able to launch a surprise attack on Asgard, using their nimbleness and durability to smash through the Asgardian defenses, though two of the ships were destroyed by the Asgardians in the process. The final ship, with assistance from Algrim, now the last of the Kursed, managed to break through the Asgardian defenses and disgorge its complement of Dark Elf soldiers, along with Malekith himself. The Dark Elves engaged the Asgardian soldiers, both sides suffering heavy casualties as Malekith made for the chambers of Frigga. The Dark Elves were eventually driven away, bereft of their prize, losing three ships and dozens of soldiers in the process.When Thor, Foster, and Loki came to Svartalfheim in order to trick Malekith into removing the Aether from Foster where it would be destroyed, a number of Dark Elves accompanied Malekith and Algrim onto the field. In the ensuing fight, Loki and Thor killed all of the present Dark Elves, including Algrim, though seemingly at the cost of Loki's life. The rest went to Earth, where they could disperse the Aether to all nine realms and destroy the universe.

The Destroyer unquestionably obeyed the ruler of Asgard and wielder of Gungnir, no matter who the ruler may be at any given time."," The Destroyer's large size and construction give it formidable physical power, enough to bat away a car hurled at it, and send Volstagg flying with apparent ease. The Destroyer's immense superhuman strength enables it to effortlessly kill a being of human strength and resilience with as little as a backhanded strike with an open hand. This allowed it to fatally injure a mortal Thor with severe blunt trauma which sent him flying through the air. With more effort, it can kill a Frost Giant or even Asgardian with its strength, as even the combined efforts of Sif and the Warriors Three did not stand a chance against the Destroyer. Only Thor was able to hold his own against it, after fully regaining his powers.  The Destroyer is constructed of otherworldly materials that make it highly resistant to damage. Even when pierced by Sif's Asgardian lance, it was able to continue functioning. Also, no known human weaponry can harm or destroy it, with Mjølnir being the only known weapon capable of harming it.  The Destroyer powered by the Odinforce, which resembles fiery energy, can be unleashed through an aperture in its head. When it does this, part of the facial structure retracts downward into the lower face and the energy discharge lances out in a wide, orange-white, fire like a beam. This beam is extremely powerful, as the touch of it is enough to blast a car to pieces, vaporize a living being (even one as durable as a Frost Giant) or lay waste to any structure (a building, for example) it lays its ""eyes"" upon. Only beings of incredible power, like Thor, are able to withstand these blasts.  The Destroyer is able to rearrange the armor pieces that make up its body, giving it a nearly unlimited range of motion. When attacked from behind it was able to face its opponent without turning around by instead fully rotating its arms, legs, and head. This was used when Sif drove a lance through its back and the Destroyer swiftly re-positions itself to blast her.  The Destroyer is linked to whoever holds Gungnir and recognizes the spear's wielder as its master. The wielder of Gungnir can perceive whatever transpires around the armor and pilot it by partially possessing it, even if they are separated at vast distances across the Nine Realms. Thus, it can be stopped by an attack on its master, should they have left themselves vulnerable to attack. It was first commanded by Odin, and then by Loki. Odin seemed to be able to use it to Frost Giants breaking into his vault, and that Loki was using it to try and kill Thor while he was in possession of Gungnir.",30,90,55,90,80,60,"['Cold Resistance', 'Durability', 'Energy Beams', 'Energy Blasts', 'Fire Resistance', 'Heat Resistance', 'Super Strength', 'Telepathy Resistance', 'Toxin and Disease Resistance', 'Vision - Heat']",[],[''],,Thor (2011),Marvel Comics,,,Asgard,[],,,Robot,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/13071.jpg?v=1554823943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

428,Edward Elric,Edward Elric,,7,"Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy. Edward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. She brought the boys to Yock Island near the town of Dublith in the southern region, where she informed them that they were to survive for one full month without alchemy. If, at the end of their ordeal, they could correctly explain the concept ""One is All and All is One"", they would begin their training under her wing. While there, the brothers discovered self-reliance and gained new abilities and insights relevant to living in the world under their own power from having to forage and hunt for food as well as fend off periodic attacks from Mason, an employee at the Curtises’ butcher shop who had disguised himself as a masked wild man at Izumi's behest. Coming to realize that, as a human, he is but a small part of the world and universe as a whole, but that the world and universe cannot exist without a collective of small parts, it is Edward who answered Izumi's riddle properly when she finally returned. For the next five months, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. Though instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation. Devising a Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound; Edward and Alphonse were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time, sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Al carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.For some time afterward, Edward remained in a sorrowful torpor until Lt. Colonel Roy Mustang arrived in Resembool on an inaccurate tip regarding possible State Alchemist candidates. Upon discovering the bloody remains of the brothers' failed experiment, Mustang confronted Edward at the Rockbell home and persuaded him to consider joining the State Alchemist program as a means to perhaps restore his limbs and his brother's body someday. Edward, driven by the guilt of what his ambition had done to his little brother, commissioned Pinako and Winry to craft him an automail arm and leg in order for him to follow Mustang's advice. When told that the surgery would be excruciating and that recovery would take at least three years, Ed commented that the pain would be nothing compared to Alphonse's suffering and promised to finish recovery in a single year. In the fall of 1911, his new automail limbs complete, twelve-year-old Edward ventured with Mustang to Central City to apply for his state certification. After passing the written examination and psychological evaluation, Edward astounded all the officials present - including the Führer, King Bradley himself - with his superb and unique abilities and even managed to win the Führer's favor with his brazenness. Within a week, he was issued his license and the symbolic title of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". On October 3rd, Edward returned to Resembool, packed up his belongings, burned down the Elric house (claiming that, without it, he and his brother would have no means of turning back from their goal) and left home with Alphonse to find a way to restore him to normal.","Despite Edward's small stature and young age, he is a remarkable combatant. Having apprenticed under Izumi Curtis, Ed was taught to condition his body through regular workouts and sparring as part of her philosophy, ""to train the spirit, first train the body."" As such, his slight frame belies a compactly muscular build that, in addition to his naturally high energy level and endurance, fuels his considerable strength and agility which allows him to throw people much bigger than he is. Due to Izumi's Spartan training, Edward has become a particularly competent hand-to-hand fighter, able to hold his own against armed opponents and even skilled martial arts practitioners. Besides that, his steel right arm and left leg augment his fighting strength by adding to his defensive and offensive capabilities as well as his speed - after he is refitted with a lighter, cold-climate automail in Chapter 70 of the manga.",90,10,35,25,25,50,"['Electrokinesis', 'Element Control', 'Energy Manipulation', 'Weapon-based Powers', 'Weapons Master']",[],"['Fullmetal Alchemist', 'Little Red Runt', 'Fullmetal', 'Ed', 'Pipsqueak, Insect, Hero of the People, Shorty, etc...']",,,,,State Alchemist,,[],"Van Hohenheim (father, deceased)

The X-Men – Colossus, Deadpool, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead – arrive to stop him.

Deadpool tries to get him to see the reality of prison, but Russell believes that he and Deadpool are a team that will protect each other. Unfortunately, Deadpool's collar stops his healing power, meaning his cancer returns. Deadpool is sure he is going to die in prison and not be useful in protecting Russell so he tries to make him see how his plan is not going to work. The Ice Box is attacked by Cable, a time-traveling mutant intent on killing Russell. In the future where Cable comes from, Russell is a serial killer, who, upon having his revenge on the headmaster, starts to enjoy killing people and commits mass murder throughout his life. In that particular timeline, he and Cable frequently clashed with one another, with the latter coming close to killing him a few times. Russell decided to hurt him by going after Cable's family. He broke into his home one night, and with Cable gone at that time, his wife and daughter were defenseless. Russell used his powers to set their home ablaze, killing Cable's family as a result. This, in turn, started Cable's mission in traveling to the past to kill Russell long before he killed his family.  During the attack on the prison, Deadpool's collar is knocked off and he manages to recover enough to fight Cable. Both Deadpool and Cable are thrown from the prison by a concussive blast. Left in the Ice Box, Russell ends up befriending the Juggernaut.After the attack on the prison, all the Ice Box prisoner are due to be transported to another facility. During the trip, the transport is attacked by Cable, although Deadpool and Domino try to stop him.

Intent on revenge, Russell, and Juggernaut head to the Essex House to kill the headmaster. Cable teams up with Deadpool and Domino to stop them, noting that this would be Russell's first kill which would set him on the path to the future that Cable is trying to avert. Deadpool tries to stop Russell by convincing him that people care for him by placing a power-dampening collar on himself and offering his life in place of the headmaster. He even takes a bullet to the heart from Cable, who was not convinced that Russell could be stopped. The sacrifice stops Russell and makes him lose his thirst for revenge upon seeing Wade die to protect him. Seeing this, Cable travels back in time to ensure that Deadpool did not die from his bullet by hiding a skee-ball token into Wilson's costume, which ends up blocking the bullet.

603,HK-47,HK-47,,-,"A self-sentient killing machine, HK-47 was far more than an ordinary combat droid. Created four thousand years ago, he came equipped with a devastating arsenal of high-powered weaponry, a ruthless and single-minded pursuit of his termination targets, and a pre-programmed disregard for all organic life. This Hunter-Killer model is one of the most dangerous assassins in the galaxy. And yet, he was also a protocol droid. The incongruity did not go unnoticed, even by HK-47. For a time, his memory was partially wiped, and he could not piece together his history. He knew that he just wanted to blast a few ""meatbags,"" but the droid wasn't sure exactly why he wanted to do that. Or how he came to regard organic life as ""meatbags."" Or why he was so well equipped to gleefully dish out violence. Instead, HK-47 found himself in a droid shop in Anchorhead, part of the Ithorian Yuka Laka's inventory of goods. The HK model was rumored to have been created by Czerka Corporation to eliminate the heads of rival companies. Units such as these were quite capable of laying waste to an entire building in an effort to dispose of a single target. This wanton carnage, combined with the tendency of the droid's previous owners to come to rather gruesome ends, has led most civilized planets to issue explicit bans on all HK-model assassin droids. But there was more to HK-47 than that. In truth, HK-47 belonged to Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith. Revan gave HK-47 the programming necessary to make the droid fluent in the difficult language of Tatooine's Sand People. It was HK-47 that helped Revan locate the ancient Star Forge map on Tatooine. To cover these tracks, Revan wiped the droid's memory of those events; ironically, the Sith Lord's memories would be wiped too. HK-47 would help Revan again once the droid was reawakened. The droid had a strong sense of loyalty. He would obey his master to the letter of the instruction, even if the Revan wanted to tinker around in his chest and try to unlock some of the droid's hidden memories and capabilities.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,[],[],[''],,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003),George Lucas,,"Hunter-Killer assassin, Jedi Hunter",,[],Darth Revan (creator),Male,Android,5'10 • 178 cm,-,Orange,No Hair,Red,/pictures2/portraits/10/050/13978.jpg?v=1575109348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
612,Hulk (2003),Bruce Banner,,15,"Young Bruce is a withdrawn and closed child, rarely outwardly expressing emotion even in extreme cases, with patches of green skin that appear when he feels intense emotions. The elder Banner, under extreme guilt for his unintentional damage to his son, is feverishly attempting to find a cure for the child's condition when the government, represented by Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, shuts down his research after learning of his dangerous experiment. David Banner, in a fit of rage, causes a massive explosion of the facilities' gamma reactor. After the accidental death of his wife, David Banner is arrested and locked away in a mental hospital, while 4-year old Bruce is sent into foster care and adopted, taking on the last name of Krenzler, and believing both his biological parents to be deceased. During his life, the repressed memories of his parents, the explosion and his young life manifest themselves as intense nightmares that leave Bruce shaken and disturbed but unable to conjure the memories. 30 years later, Bruce Banner is a brilliant researcher at the Berkeley Nuclear Biotechnology Institute. Bruce uses nano-meds, activated by gamma radiation from a device called a Gammasphere (but actually operates differently to a genuine Gammasphere), to regenerate living tissue; the nanobot experiments result in out-of-control cellular growth and are invariably fatal to their test subjects. Presenting a fusion of gamma radiation, nanotechnology and congenital mutation as responsible for the transformations, the screenplay modernizes the Hulk's origins somewhat. The military-industrial complex, represented by the unscrupulous Major Talbot, becomes interested in the research to build self-healing soldiers. David Banner reappears and begins infiltrating his son's life, working as a janitor in the lab building. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, now an army General, also begins to investigate when he learns of Bruce's involvement in the research through Talbot. Ross, the estranged father of Bruce's ex-girlfriend and co-researcher Betty Ross, becomes concerned both for his daughter's safety around Banner, but also because Bruce is working in the same field as the father he does not remember. As Bruce, Betty and their other co-scientist, Harper, continue to work towards progress in their experiments, they experience an accident during a routine power-up when there is an overload of the nanobots with Harper stuck in the lab room. Bruce saves Harper and takes the brunt of the gamma radiation himself. Afterwards, we see Bruce sitting in a hospital bed telling Betty that he's never felt better, which she can't fathom due to the fact that the nano-meds have killed everything else they've touched. The radiation has intertwined with Bruce's already-altered DNA. That night, his father confronts him, revealing their relationship and hinting at the mutation in his son. Using Bruce's DNA, he begins experimentation on animals. Soon after, the building rage within him stemming from all of the stresses building up around him (his father, Betty, Talbot and the accident) activates his gamma-radiated DNA, triggering Bruce's signature transformation into the Hulk. His father sees him in his transformed state, and is in both awe and horror of what he has created, deepening his obsession. After the destruction at the lab, Banner is found unconscious and at home by Betty. Bruce barely remembers his transformation, a sensation similar to birth. Ross arrives, suspicious, and places him under house arrest as well as taking over Bruce and Betty's lab. Betty confronts David Banner for answers, but only succeeds in angering him when she reveals her father's involvement. That night, David phones Bruce and tells him he has unleashed three mutant dogs to her house. Enraged and attacked by Talbot (who believes Bruce has deliberately cut him out of the loop by giving Ross control of the lab) Bruce transforms again and, after seriously injuring Talbot and his henchmen, manages to save Betty. The next morning, Bruce is tranquillized and taken to an enormous underground base in the desert. Betty convinces her father to allow her to attempt to help Bruce control his transformations, but Ross remains extremely sceptical, believing Bruce is ""damned"" to follow in his father's footsteps. In the meantime, David Banner breaks into the lab and subjects himself to the nano-meds and the gamma-sphere, gaining the ability to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he can touch. Talbot, seeing an opportunity to profit from the Hulk's strength and regenerative capability, goes over Ross' head and takes over custody of Bruce, sending Betty away. When attacking and taunting Bruce fails, Talbot puts him in a sensory deprivation tank and induces a nightmare that triggers his repressed memories. David Banner confronts Betty and offers to turn himself in. In exchange, he asks to speak to Bruce ""one last time"". He also recounts to Betty his experience with his young son, revealing that he intended to kill Bruce after General Ross threw him off the project, believing his son's mutation would grow out of control. However, he accidentally killed his wife instead when she tried to defend her child. Remembering the entire event, Bruce finally transforms; killing Talbot (who fires an explosive missile at the Hulk that ricochets off of his tough skin and backfires towards him) and escaping the base in the process. He battles the army in the desert, defeating 4 tanks and two Comanche Helicopters, and leaps all the way to San Francisco to find Betty again. Betty contacts her father and convinces him to take her to meet the Hulk, believing that he needs ""a chance to calm down"". Bruce's love for her comes through, and he transforms back into his human state. At night, David is taken to a base to talk to Bruce. As a precaution, Ross has placed Banner between two large electrical generators which will kill them both with a massive electrical surge when activated. David, having descended into megalomania, rants of how the military and their weapons have ruined their lives, and dismisses Bruce as a pathetic shell of his ""true son"", with whom he can destroy the military. He bites into a wire, and absorbs the electricity to become a powerful electrical being, and Bruce transforms to battle him. The two fight in the sky before landing near a lake, where David takes on properties of rocks and water. He tries to absorb his son's power, but is unable to contain the grief and pain that is its driving force, and swells to an energy bubble. Ross orders a weapon (a Gamma Charge Bomb) be fired into the lake, and David's swelled form is destroyed, leaving no trace of either man. A year later, Ross talks to Betty on the phone. Bruce is presumed dead, but there have been sightings of the Hulk in various locations, and Betty is under 24-hour surveillance. Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, Bruce is a doctor whose medical camp comes under siege by guerrillas. When they raid his camp, he tells them in Spanish, ""You're making me angry, You wouldn't like me when I'm angry"". His eyes become green, and the camera pans back to show the rainforest, just as it fades to green and a roar is heard.",,95,100,60,80,100,90,"['Accelerated Healing', 'Agility', 'Cold Resistance', 'Durability', 'Element Control', 'Endurance', 'Energy Manipulation', 'Heat Resistance', 'Intelligence', 'Invulnerability', 'Jump', 'Latent Abilities', 'Longevity', 'Regeneration', 'Size Changing', 'Stamina', 'Super Speed', 'Super Strength', 'Toxin and Disease Resistance']","['Bruce Banner', 'Bruce Banner (Hulkbuster) (MCU)', 'Bruce Banner (Wild West)', 'Captain Universe (Hulk)', 'Doc Green', 'Ego Hulk', 'Grey Hulk', 'Heart Of The Monster Hulk', 'Hulk', 'Hulk (1978)', 'Hulk (classic)', 'Hulk (MCU)', 'Hulk (Stark Gauntlet) (MCU)', 'Hulk (Worthy)', 'Hulk Earth-5901', 'Hulkpool', 'Immortal Hulk', 'Incredible Hulk (Universal)', 'Indestructible Hulk', 'Infernal Hulk', 'Maestro Hulk', 'Merged Hulk', 'Mr. Fixit', 'Nul: Breaker Of Worlds', 'Professor Hulk', 'Professor Hulk (MCU)', 'Professor Hulk (Nano Gauntlet MCU)', 'Space Punisher Hulk', 'The Hulk (Earth 7642)', 'War Hulk', 'World Breaker Hulk', 'World War Hulk', 'Zombie Hulk', 'Zombie Hulk (Power Cosmic)']",[''],,,Marvel Comics,,,,[],,,,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/14849.jpg?v=1554309338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
613,Hulk 2099,John Eisenhart,,16,"In one possible future, the Marvel Universe of the year Marvel 2099 is vastly different than the one we exist in now. The age of heroes has ended long ago and much of the country is run by corporations which use violence to grow and expand, giving an all-new meaning to the phrase ""corporate take-over."" In Los Angeles, the base of operations for Hulk 2099, things are even worse. In 2076, a band of eco-terrorists detonated California's fault lines, creating a moat which separated Western California from the rest of the nation, causing it to descend further into the hands of corrupt corporate villains. However, there was a cult that lived in the California-region called the ""Knights of Banner"" who worshiped the Hulk of the 20th century and lived by a code of honor. Tired of the state of society, they began experiments with gamma radiation to create a new Hulk which would save the people from their terrible position in life. The enigmatic lifestyle of the Knights attracted L.A. movie studios, which wanted to make a film based on their lifestyle. One studio in particular, Lotusland Entertainment, sent their ruthless dealmaker John Eisenhart to meet the Knights of Banner and secure the rights to their story. However, the Knights, who were more interested in honor and integrity than Hollywood money, turned him down. However, John didn't take ""no"" for an answer and tricked a young boy in the Knights, Gawain, to reveal the Knight's secrets to him. Gawain revealed that the Knights were carrying out illegal gamma experiments to recreate the Hulk. John, who had no reservations to play dirty to get what he wanted, reported the Knight's activities. Unexpectedly for John, an armada of police attacked and slaughtered the Knights. John tried to stop them, but the only one who he could save was Gawain. But in the process, the Knight's gamma weapon discharged and John was turned into the Hulk 2099. Now haunted by the guilt of getting all of the Knights killed, John swore to protect the Gawain, the last of the Knights of Banner. However, even that failed when a man/machine named Draco committed a violent corporate takeover of Lotusland. In the process, Gawain was killed. Hulk 2099 dedicated himself to defending the people from monsters like Draco and became a leader in a rebellion against them. After President Victor Von Doom's takeover of America, John stole a gamma device from one of Doom's henchmen in order to keep it from Doom himself. This device was similar to the one that granted John the ability to transform into his Hulk-like form. Draco goes on to inform John that if he doesn't turn the device over to him, he will detonate a massive bomb placed directly on the city's fault line. In the ensuing battle, the bomb detonated and triggered a massive earthquake. The earthquake set off the gamma device that resulted in a massive explosion, laying waste to the city. John emerged from the rubble, mutated even more so by the radiation emitted from the device. His mutation stabilized and he returned to his original form just prior to S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived in the region. While battling them, John seemingly perished",,95,100,70,80,100,60,"['Cold Resistance', 'Durability', 'Endurance', 'Heat Resistance', 'Invulnerability', 'Jump', 'Regeneration', 'Stamina', 'Super Strength']",[],[''],"Hollywood, California",2099 Unlimited #1,Marvel Comics,,"Concept hunter, lawyer",California,[],"Marian Eisenhart (sister), unnamed parents",Male,Human / Radiation,12'0 • 366 cm,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/11479.jpg?v=1554299218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The hope was that its power could act as a safer, cleaner energy source than the current technology on Earth possessed. Asgard moved over Slokovia after Asgardian worshipers were killed. Storms raged and the Valkyrior were sent to collect the dead. Doctor Doom was secretly manipulating events, supplying one group with weapons while offering the others asylum in Latveria. Stark was asked by the US government to talk to Thor and convince him to leave before United Nations forces entered the area. Thor refused to do so. Doom then contacted Stark and told him he would need to use the crystal to have any chance at stopping Thor, who now wielded his father's Odin-Force in addition to his already great power. Stark designed the Thorbuster armor, giving it a look somewhat similar to the Destroyer armor and used it in a confrontation with Thor. Thor was surprised at its power and that Tony would turn a 'gift from the gods into a weapon.' He destroyed the reactor and Iron Man ejected from it. Only the intervention of Captain America was sufficient to prevent military involvement. He too tried to talk Thor down, but got his shield dented in the process.

695,Joker (Gotham),Jeremiah Valeska,,10,"Jeremiah Valeska is a terrorist, criminal and murderer. He is also the more arrogant and obsessive identical twin brother of the anarchistic cult leader, Jerome Valeska. After Jerome's death and being exposed to his altered chemical laughing toxin driving him to insanity, Jeremiah takes over the role of main antagonist for the final arc of Season Four and a major antagonist in Season Five.  As a child, Jeremiah supposedly suffered years of abuse at the hands of his insane brother, who apparently burnt Jeremiah's bed while Jeremiah himself was in it. Jeremiah would in turn manufacture several lies about his brother that would turn Jerome's entire family against him; it remains unclear how much truth there was in either story. In a desperate attempt to defend Jeremiah from his monstrous brother, his uncle took him away from Haly's Circus, in which his mother Lila worked, and proceeded to take him to St. Ignatius. Following this Jeremiah changed his name and started calling himself Xander Wilde. After finishing school, Jeremiah became a brilliant engineer, designing highly advanced generators for Wayne Enterprises. He also built a labyrinth hideout to protect himself from his brother, which took almost six years of construction. In addition to the hideout which he filled with security cameras, rooms of work and more, he met a young woman named Ecco who started to work for him as a proxy and assistant. Jeremiah would later reunite with his brother, who after a rampage to find his twin, found him in his hideout. Right after witnessing his brother's death, Jeremiah received a gift sent by Jerome, which is revealed to be a ""special"" gas created just for him. Upon inhaling it, his face became pale white and a wide red grin formed from ear to ear, finally giving Jeremiah the drive to explore that dark side of him that his brother Jerome had seen. Becoming obsessed with both Bruce Wayne (whom he quickly became friends with each other) and re-building Gotham in his own image after destroying it, he eventually formed an alliance with Ra's al Ghul. After mortally injuring Selina Kyle in an attempt to destroy Bruce's attachments and drive him insane, Jeremiah killed the mayor and demolished all of Gotham's bridges, cutting the city off from the rest of the world and paving the way for Bruce to become the ""Dark Knight"" Ra's had foreseen. With Gotham City reduced to a lawless ""no-man's land"", Jeremiah managed to escape into the night, remaining on the loose in the abandoned city. After Selina recovers, she tracks down Jeremiah and stabs him multiple times with the intent to kill him. Jeremiah survives and proceeds with his plan to reenact the Wayne murders, using Jim Gordon and Lee Thompkins as stand ins, hoping their murders would give him and Bruce a permanent connection. His plan is foiled by Selina’s intervention, and Jeremiah is severely disfigured and brain dead after falling into a vat of chemcials - which ultimately leads to him losing his identity. He is currently in a coma whilst in the custody of Bruce Wayne. Despite this, his secondary plan to prevent the reunification with the mainland succeeds, leaving Gotham’s river polluted with toxic chemicals.","Jeremiah is shown to be highly intelligent. Since he was a child, he used to draw mazes, and when he grew up, after having the best grades at school, he built one in his house, which he built underneath the woods. Furthermore, he is extremely manipulative as he was able to keep anyone from discovering his insanity for years, even after it was brought to the forefront by Jerome's gas, and he was able to convince everyone that he was Jerome in the tapes he sent to Jerome's followers and the GCPD. Jeremiah also claims to be ""vastly more intelligent"" than Jerome was.

All were detested by their father, but he detested the six younger children so much (mainly for their ugliness) that he imprisoned them in the terrifying abyss of Tartarus, which was itself deep within the Earth. Enraged at Ouranos and his actions, Gaea then gathered her remaining twelve children, the Titans, to free their brothers and overthrow their arrogant and sadistic father. Kronos was the boldest, as well as the most ruthless and devious and cruelest of the siblings (even though he was the youngest) and, initially, only he would agree to help his mother. While growing up, Kronos would frequently resort to dirty fighting tactics while wrestling his elder brothers, earning his infamous nickname ""The Crooked One."" Furthermore, as the youngest of the twelve Titans, Kronos was initially ignored by his parents (who even had trouble recalling his name), which inspired the young Titan to prove himself as superior to his elder brothers, in any possible way. This is also what inspired him to sadistically murder his father. Though the youngest, Kronos proved himself as a natural leader, and was able to convince all of his Titan brothers (except for Oceanus) to aid him in their father's murder.

Five thousand years later, Algrim did not hesitate to sacrifice his own life to be transformed into the last of the Kursed to gain their revenge upon Asgard.

819,Lord Of Cinder,Gwyn,,12,"Before the flame existed, little of Gwyn's life is known, save that he had an uncle named Lloyd. He was surrounded by knights when he found the flame, and was dressed in his regalia, so it is possible that he may have been a king long before that moment. At the dawn of the Age of Fire, Gwyn discovered a Lord Soul along with the Furtive Pygmy, Gravelord Nito, and the Witch of Izalith. His soul allowed him to manipulate light, and generate a substance called lightning. They allied with Seath the Scaleless and amassed an army, and with their power, challenged the Everlasting Dragons for dominion of the World. His mighty bolts peeled apart their ancient scales, allowing them to be killed by other attacks, and they were ultimately defeated, but not eliminated. And thus the Age of Fire began, with Gwyn becoming the king of Lordran. He lived with his clan, who became a new and varied race known as Gods, in their city of Anor Londo. They often hunted the descendants of the dragons for sport, for which many of their powers were developed. This did not include Seath, for he received recognition for his deeds, and was made a part of the nobility. When the flames began to fade, Gwyn and the other Lords did all they could to find a solution. The Witch of Izalith attempted to recreate the First Flame from her own Lord's Soul, but the attempt went horribly awry, mutating the Witch into the terrible Bed of Chaos, which spewed forth malformed demons whom Gwyn's faithful Silver Knights fought, but the flames of the demons charred their armor black, thus becoming Black Knights. Seeing no other choice, Gwyn left Anor Londo and traveled to the Kiln of the First Flame, to link the First Flame, thus prolonging the Age of Fire. When he left, he divided his own soul among his clan and his children, and granted parts to both the Four Kings and Seath, along with others. In linking the flame, Gwyn sacrificed himself; with his powerful soul providing fuel for the flames, prolonging the Age of Fire. A great many of his Black Knights followed him into the Kiln and were reduced to ash when he linked the fire, wandering Lordran as disembodied spirits for eternity. His Lord Soul was able to keep the fire burning for centuries, but it left Gwyn to Hollow. It is implied that at least one thousand years have passed when the events of Dark Souls begin. Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight, Kingseeker Frampt and Darkstalker Kaathe give the Chosen Undead alternating viewpoints of Gwyn. Gwynevere claims that it is the Chosen Undead's duty to succeed Gwyn, stating that their success would ""avert further Undead sacrifices"" and that without Fire, ""all shall be a frigid and frightful Dark"" – a perspective that Frampt shares. As this Gwynevere is actually an illusion, whether or not they are being entirely truthful is left unresolved. On the other hand, Kaathe asserts that the Age of Dark – the apparent ""age of men"" – would naturally follow the Age of Fire, but Gwyn, in dire fear of both the Dark and humans, resisted the course of nature by sacrificing himself to link the Fire. Unlike Frampt, Kaathe believes it is the Chosen Undead's fate to ""destroy the fading Lord Gwyn, [...] become the Fourth Lord, [and] usher in an Age of Dark"".",,85,60,50,75,100,80,"['Agility', 'Dexterity', 'Durability', 'Electrical Transport', 'Electrokinesis', 'Element Control', 'Energy Manipulation', 'Fire Control', 'Fire Resistance', 'Heat Generation', 'Heat Resistance', 'Immortality', 'Intelligence', 'Invulnerability', 'Magic', 'Melting', 'Peak Human Condition', 'Power Augmentation', 'Stamina', 'Weapon-based Powers', 'Weapons Master', 'Weather Control']",[],[''],,,Namco,,,,[],,,,-,-,,,,/pictures2/portraits/11/050/15032.jpg?v=1547937454,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

William swore vengeance, finding and donning the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf. Owayodata visited him and imbued the young man with his spiritual legacy, granting him superhuman powers.

Alongside Phantom Rider III, Firebird, Texas Twister, and Shooting Star, he battled the Hulk, and rescued Rick Jones from the Corruptor. Red Wolf joined these other four heroes as part of the first incarnation of the short-lived superhero team, the Rangers. Alongside the Defenders, Red Wolf battled some trolls. Alongside the Rangers again, Red Wolf battled the West Coast Avengers while under the influence of the demon Riglevio possessing Shooting Star.

They were part of an attack on a village that resulted in the slaughter of the parents of The Bengal.

When Quill betrayed the Ravagers and stole the Orb for himself, Udonta led the hunt for his former ally. Eventually Udonta caught up with Quill but he was convinced to help him in the war against Ronan the Accuser, who was threatening to use the Orb's power to destroy Xandar, with Quill ensuring Udonta did not get the Infinity Stone at the end.
